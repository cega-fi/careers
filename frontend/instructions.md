# Overview
We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and build a solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and attention to user experience. The best solution is one that is easy for the end-user and easy for developers to debug/test/extend.

Ideally, we should be able to run your solution locally and visualize the results in a browser!

## Exercise 1: Multichain Wallet Connections
### User Story: As a defi degen user

* I want to see a summary of total deposits and transactions
  * Page should show the sum of deposits in dollars (two decimals) across chains (labeled as TVL)
  * Page should load even if no chain is specified / wallet connected
* I want to connect my wallet
  * I should be able to choose what chain I want to connect to
  * I should be able to connect to a corresponding wallet (based on chain)
  * I should be able to see what my wallet address is when I'm connected
  * I should be able to disconnect my wallet
* I want to deposit some money (note: no money is deposited, just use the API endpoint to mock)
  * I should be depositing to the chain I've selected
  * I shouldn't be able to deposit unless I'm connected to a wallet

### API Mock Details
* Wallet Connectors
  * Ethereum: feel free to use wagmi.sh, ethers.js, RainbowKit, etc...
