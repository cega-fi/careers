# Hiring @ Cega

Hello! We're so glad to have met you and had a chance to share more about working at [Cega](https://cega.fi). :tada: !

In order to move forward, we'd like to learn about how working with you on a day-to-day setting might look like. To that end, this repository contains a set of **short, time-boxed** (approximately 2-4 hours max) that you can use demonstrate your skills and abilities.

The goal of these exercises is to give you an asynchronous medium for demonstrating how you would break down a set of user stories and requirements into a proof-of-concept. Your submission will help us understand your thought process as an engineer and the decisions/trade-offs that you make. We know that four hours is not a lot of time and you might feel pressured to do more. Please truly hold yourself to the 4 hours max and make sure to create the `ROADMAP.md` file as outlined in the instructions below.

## First, a few words about why we do take-home exercises

* üåé  ~ We're a fully-remote team with folks spread across many time zones! Async exercises allow you to show off your skills at a time/place that works for you.

* üõ† ~ It matches the nature of our work. Most of being an engineer on a remote team is self-directed exploration of a problem, followed by period(s) of cyclic work/edit/review with your peers.

* ‚è≥  ~ Take-home exercises allow you to work at your own pace and break up the time into as many sessions as you wish.

* üëÅ ~ It eliminates the performance anxiety of forced-pairing with someone whom you've just met.

* üß∞ ~ It allows you to use the tools, languages, and frameworks that you are familar with.

## General Instructions

1. Choose an exercise directory that matches your primary domain. This is the area in which you feel the most comfortable and have the highest degree of mastery
    * [frontend](frontend/instructions.md)

2. Read the `instructions.md` file in the matching directory. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and ask any clarifying questions to us!

3. Create a new **private repository** for your exercise and add the Cega hiring team members as private collaborators (We do this to preserve your anonymity.)
    * [Vic](https://github.com/vizhang) 
    * [Fel](https://github.com/feliciacx0)

4. Complete as much of the exercise as you can in 4 hours or less. Unless otherwise specified in the `instructions.md` document, you can use any language, framework, or toolchain you wish, although ideally this would be, Solidity, Typescript, React, and SQL (purely because those are the languages we use to build Cega and will be the most familiar with)

5. Be sure to include the following in your submission
    * a `README.md` with the following information
        * **A few screenshots of the finished product**. Show off that work! üì∏
        * The exercise you choose and why
        * A short explanation of what you built
        * How to test/demo/run
        * Any feedback/notes (i.e. if something was hard, confusing, frustrating, etc)
        * Anything else you'd lke us to know about your submission
    * a `ROADMAP.md` with what you would add/change if you had more time. Dream big.
    * a super-simple test suite if applicable (even one test is a bonus)
    * Some form of lightweight technical documentation (code comments are fine)

5. When complete email a link to the repository and any special instructions to the individual you spoke with at Cega.

6. Sit back and relax. We'll review your submission and get back to you with next steps! :bicep:
